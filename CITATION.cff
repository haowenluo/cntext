  This is a fork of the cntext library adapted for English
  text analysis. The library provides comprehensive text
  analysis capabilities including semantic projection based
  on word embedding models, traditional methods such as word
  count, readability metrics, document similarity, sentiment
  analysis, and LLM integration. Originally designed for
  Chinese text analysis, this fork focuses on English text
  while maintaining the innovative semantic analysis methods
  of the original project.
